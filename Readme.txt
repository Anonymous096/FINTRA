Problem Statement that has given on the HACKATHON DAY is:
JAVASCRIPT: Personal Finance Tracker - Create a web-based personal finanace tracker using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The application should allow users to add, edit, and delete income and expense transactions and display the current balance. Use GitHub Copilot to guide you in implementing features, handling user input, and designing a responsive user interface.

So this was the problem given to us so if you chose JavaScript this was the problem but if you had chosen Python or Java or Ruby the problem statement is different.

Fintra does not contain any Edit and Delete function only contain add function but its not in the loop you can only add once.
Basically it's only a Design but soon it will work..

I will update this whenever I update the files in JavaScript.
